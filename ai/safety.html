        <p class="text-dark">With many of the world’s top minds questioning the safety of artificial intelligence, it has become a hot topic in today’s society. The major concern of AI safety is that it will grow at a rate in which human control is totally irrelevant making
          it impossible to stop. Secondly it is feared that AI would not feel any obligation to abide by human laws and ethics leaving nothing to stop them from wiping us out. There have been certain actions taken by different groups in an effort to
          combat the potential risks, for example the U.N. has put in place a law banning the use of autonomous weapons. As well, there are many organizations attempting to raise awareness to the potential dangers, such as the Future of Life Institute,
          which has raised nearly 10 million USD for their cause. All in all, AI should be approached with care and ease, lest it grow out of control and destroy humanity. </p>
