          <br>Both the 9/10 and 11/12 State High TSA chapters are part of PATSA Region 8 and have participated in TSA for many years. We are located in State College, Pennsylvania, and attend State College Area High School, a historically high-performing
          school with a 93% high school graduation rate. Our school routinely achieves impressive performances in TSA, sending students to States and then Nationals every year. We encourage students to engage in community service projects and operate
          with an "Education First" attitude. One way we do this is by advertising certain community service projects such as a 5k to help fight cancer.&nbsp;Both State High chapters strive to follow the TSA motto of "Learning to lead in a technical
          world" and we accomplish this by working as a team at weekly practices to develop the best understanding of various aspects of STEM. In addition, we elect a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Reporter, and Sergeant-at-Arms to
          develop and practice leadership skills.
